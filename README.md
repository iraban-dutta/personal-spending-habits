# personal-spending-habits
In this project we have tried to study our spending habits from personal bank statements.  

## Project Highlights:
  - Data cleaning
    - The data we have used is from our own bak statements
    - This raw data required a lot of cleaning before we could perform the exploratory analysis
  - EDA on the cleaned data
    - Addressing the problem statement and also looking for interesting facts about the data
  - Tableau Dashboard for effective information consumption

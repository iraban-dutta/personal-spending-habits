# personal-spending-habits
In this project we have tried to study our spending habits from personal bank statements.  

## Project Highlights:
  - Data cleaning
    - The data we have used is from our own bak statements
    - This raw data required a lot of cleaning before we could perform the exploratory analysis
  - EDA on the cleaned data
    - Addressing the problem statement and also looking for interesting facts about the data
  - Tableau Dashboard for effective information consumption

## Answering the following questions using EDA:
For this project we have analysed the transactions from a single bank A/C (which we use for making our daily payments).
- **Overview:**
  - Number of Debit vs Credit transactions
  - Number of transactions across different transaction modes & categories
- **Debit transactions:**
  - How many transactions and what amount of money was transferred to our own self, family and friends? (Money transferred to own self includes money transferred to other bank A/Cs owned by me, cash withdrawls etc.)
  - Which payment mode is used most frequently?
  - Is there a bias of choosing a particular payment mode for making high-value transactions?
  - Which category records:
    - the highest number of transactions?
    - the maximum total amount debited across all transactions?
  - Do we tend to use a particular payment mode for a particular category?
  - Can we identify ouliers in our debit transactions?
  - What can we comment on the median transaction amount:
    - across all transactions?
    - across different transaction modes and categories?
- **Temporal trend of debit transactios:**
  - YoY & MoM spending
  - Classifying categories into daily needs and daily wants
  - ***Needs:***
    - YoY spending on needs.
    - Which categories in daily needs have the highest expenditure?
    - What are the different insurance products we own and how much are we spending on them?
    - What modes of public transport do we use?
    - What is the median number of days we wait before getting successive haircuts?
  - ***Wants:***
    - YoY spending on wants.
    - Which categories in daily wants have the highest expenditure?
    - Do we tend to spend more on our wants across specific months in a year? Does the festival season in India have any impact on this?
    - Which are the our popular retail outlets?
    - How much did we spend on the different vacations we took in the last 2.5years?
    - How frequently in a week do we order food or eat outside?
    - What is maximum amount we spent in a single day eating outside? Is this an outlier or do we generally spend around this maximum amount?
    
## Tableau Dashboard:
- The dasboard summarizes our spending habits across:
  - Year.
  - Transaction modes.
  - Transaction categories.
  - Total number of transactions, total amount spent, median, maximum and minimum amount are also shown.
- Filter action:
  - We can individually filter on the basis of year, transaction mode, transaction category or any of these combinations and the dashboard reacts accordingly.
  - We show a needs vs wants split for our selection.
  - We can also see the top-5 beneficiaries for our selection.
